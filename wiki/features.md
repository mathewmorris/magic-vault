[Reddit thread I liked and thought had some feature value](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/v74cik/what_would_you_want_out_of_a_mtg_card_collection/)

A list of features someone put that I thought was pretty good:

 - A goldfish environment- this would mean being able to draw a hand, shuffle, play cards etc.

 - A trade binder- a separate folder that has only the things i have to trade

 - A received/recently purchased binder- a separate folder to add only the things i traded for or bought (it would be nice if you could add notes on what it was for)

 - Gain/loss tracking- much like in the MTG manager app being able to see how specs are doing across the collection would be great

 - A top x price change over time tracker- again like mtg manager i like having the ability to see how cards fluctuate in price

 - Either a build in or link to rulings that deal with the card you click on

 - A link to a page where combos or synergies with cards are so that people can easily see the top combos and some cards that work well with whatever card they had in mind.

 - A trade tracker- essentially a side//side b put cards on either side and the value of the total pops up on bottom for those who value trade. It would be cool to figure out a way to have a tertiary trader as well.

 - The ability to see deck statistics, such as but not limited to- mana curve, total cost, mana points (how many of each different mana symbol shows across the deck), harder to implement and maybe a user implemented thing but a redundancy tracker? Many places use cards that have the same or similar effects so being able to see how many of a certain effect are in decks would be helpful.

 - Differnt printings by clicking on the same card

 - A deckbuilding area that does not add the card to your overall collection and one that does( this way you can test a deck idea without the card being inadvertently added to a collection price total)

 - A way to view how many of a given card i have across the collection as a whole and how many are in decks without having to look at each deck/binder( like a collection page that has you have this card in x/x decks and have x of this card.

 - A search function
